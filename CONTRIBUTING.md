# Contributing to RMSL

RMSL builds a shader node graph in TypeScript and emits GLSL ES 3.00 and WGSL.
Almost everything lives in `src/rmsl.ts`.

Most mistakes here are silent: a wrong result type or a missing table entry
produces a shader that reads fine and that no driver accepts. The test setup
exists to catch those, so it is worth reading first.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test:setup   # Chromium build used to compile GLSL, once
pnpm test
```

`pnpm type-check` and `pnpm build` do what they say.

## Tests

Three layers.

**Text.** `src/rmsl-usage.test.ts` asserts on the generated source. Cheap and
weak — `refract(I, N)` still contains `refract(`.

**Validity.** Automatic, and the important one. That file imports the compilers
under an alias:

```typescript
import {
  recordingGLSL as compileGLSL,
  recordingWGSL as compileWGSL,
} from "./testing/shader-validity";
```

The stand-ins compile every program to *both* backends and record it. An
`afterAll` hands the whole set to Chromium's WebGL2 compiler and to Dawn, and
fails the run on any rejection. A test asserting only on GLSL still has its WGSL
output checked by a real driver.

So: **write codegen tests in `src/rmsl-usage.test.ts`.** A new file importing
`compileGLSL` from `../rmsl` directly gets the text layer only, silently.

**Values.** `src/rmsl-eval.test.ts` runs the expression on real hardware and
reads the number back from both backends. Text and validity both pass for a
shader that computes the wrong thing — swapping `min` for `max` is invisible to
them. Operands arrive as function parameters, not literals, or constant folding
computes the answer before codegen runs.

Add a case here when operands could plausibly be emitted in the wrong order:
`min`/`max`, the edge order in `step(edge, x)`.

**Types.** `src/rmsl.test-d.ts` asserts what the signatures promise, with
`expectTypeOf`. Several defects here were a signature saying one thing while
the node was another — a comparison declared as returning a single boolean
while building a boolean vector — which no runtime assertion can see.

```bash
pnpm test:types    # just these
pnpm type-check    # catches them too, as ordinary type errors
```

Add a case whenever an operation's result type is not simply its receiver's:
anything that reduces, anything whose defining operand is not the first.

**Drawing.** `src/scene/renderer.test.ts` and
`src/scene/webgpu-renderer-draw.test.ts` bundle the scene library, draw in a
real browser and read the pixels back — the WebGL renderer through Chromium's
SwiftShader, the WebGPU one through a real adapter.

Getting WebGPU there took two things that are not flags, and both are in
`src/testing/gpu.ts`. `navigator.gpu` is exposed only to a secure context, so
the page is served from `http://127.0.0.1` rather than being `about:blank` like
the GLSL one. And Playwright's default browser is the headless *shell*, which
has no adapter behind `navigator.gpu`, so the WebGPU browser is launched with
`channel: "chromium"` — and separately from the GLSL browser, whose SwiftShader
arguments take the WebGPU adapter away.

This layer is worth adding to whenever the renderers do something neither the
compilers nor a stub can be asked about: binding groups, uploading, culling,
blending, instancing. The WebGPU renderer went a long time with no test that
drew anything, and two bugs that made every textured material draw nothing sat
there the whole time.

### Skipping the GPU layers

The layers that need a graphics device are **on by default**, so a plain
`vitest run` — what an editor runs, and what you get without reading this file
— hands every shader to a real compiler. They were opt-in once, and two
renderer tests reached main broken because a normal run never executed them.

Turn them off only where the machine cannot run them, or to get a fast inner
loop and a workable mutation run:

| Variable | Turns off |
|---|---|
| `RMSL_SKIP_GPU` | every layer needing a device or a browser, drawing included |
| `RMSL_SKIP_SHADER_VALIDATION` | validity only |
| `RMSL_SKIP_SHADER_EVALUATION` | evaluating the two shading languages |

```bash
pnpm test          # everything, including the GPU layers
pnpm test:fast     # RMSL_SKIP_GPU=1, well under a second
pnpm test:mutate   # mutation testing with those layers off
```

Nothing turns off the CPU target: it needs no hardware, so it evaluates on
every run, and the two shading languages are checked against what it computed.

Skipping is announced on stderr, and says how much went unchecked, because a
run without these layers proves much less than it appears to — the score from a
mutation run measures the text assertions alone. On a machine with no graphics
device, set `RMSL_SKIP_GPU=1` and say so in the pull request, since the full run
is what a change is judged on.

## Adding an operation

A method on `Node` — `.mix()`, `.length()`, `.lessThan()`.

1. **Declare it** on an operation interface (`ArithOps`, `FloatMathOps`,
   `ComparisonOps`, `VecCommonOps`, `MatOps`, …). Declare the *result* type:
   `length(): Node<"float">`. Do not declare one operation on two interfaces
   that both apply to the same type — the checker picks one arbitrarily, which
   is how `step` once shipped broken.
2. **Add to `NodeOps`** only if you introduced a new interface.
3. **Implement on `NodeImpl`**, routing through `op1` (unary), `op` (n-ary),
   `comp` (comparisons), or a direct `node({...})` when the result type is
   unrelated to the operands. Argument order follows the target languages, not
   the fluent chain — `step` puts the receiver last. `NodeImpl` does not
   `implements` the operation interfaces, so nothing warns you if you skip this.
4. **`REDUCING_OPS`** — if the result type differs from the operand type.
   Skipped: `vec3 x = length(v);`.
5. **`VALUE_OPERAND`** — if the operand defining the result type is not the
   first. Skipped: `vec3.step(0.5)` types itself from the edge.
6. **`UNIFORM_OPERAND_OPS`** — if every operand must share the defining
   operand's type, so a scalar gets broadcast. Skipped: GLSL usually still
   accepts it and WGSL does not. Leave out operations whose argument is
   genuinely scalar — `mix(a, b, t)`, `refract(i, n, eta)`.
7. **`tryFold`** — optional, for operations with an exact scalar JavaScript
   equivalent.
8. **GLSL case** in `compileGLSLNode`, via `unaryGLSL` / `binaryGLSL` /
   `ternaryGLSL` / `comparisonGLSL`. `binaryGLSL(node, ctx, "pow", true)`
   renders a call; without the flag, an infix operator.
9. **WGSL case** in `compileWGSLNode`, via `unaryWGSL` / `binaryWGSL` /
   `ternaryWGSL` / `shiftWGSL`. There is no `comparisonWGSL` — WGSL comparisons
   are plain operators.
10. **Check the backends agree** on name, argument order and semantics.
    `inversesqrt` is `inverseSqrt` in WGSL; GLSL needs `lessThan(a, b)` for
    vectors; WGSL shifts take `u32`; WGSL has no `inverse()` and pulls a helper
    from `WGSL_HELPERS`.
11. **Document** in `docs/api.md`.
12. **Test** in `src/rmsl-usage.test.ts`, driven from a `uniform(...)` — with
    literals the expression folds and codegen never runs.

Both switches throw on an unhandled node type, so steps 8 and 9 fail loudly —
provided a test exercises them.

## Adding a shader type

1. **`ShaderType` union.**
2. **`NodeOps` row** — `{}` if it carries no operations. The only step the type
   checker enforces, as
   `error TS2536: Type 'A' cannot be used to index type 'NodeOps'`. It will not
   name your type.
3. **`typeToGLSL`** — a missing row falls back to `float` rather than erroring.
4. **`typeToWGSL`** — falls back to `f32`.
5. **`TYPE_WIDTH`**, if the type is scalar- or vector-shaped. Drives comparison
   result width, scalar broadcasting and WGSL narrowing; a missing row means
   width 1, which quietly disables all three.
6. **Literal case** in both switches, if the type has literal values.
7. **Constructor**, if the type is constructible. The `bvec` types have none —
   they only arise as comparison results.
8. **`wrapValue` and the `…Like` aliases**, if raw JavaScript values should
   coerce to it. `wrapValue` reads arrays by length, so an array-shaped type
   collides with the existing 2/3/4/9/16 mapping.
9. **Swizzle map**, if the type is swizzleable. The runtime `swizzle()` derives
   its result from pattern length and from the source type's `ivec`/`uvec`
   prefix (a single component of an integer vector is that integer scalar), so
   the type-level map is what keeps a wrong swizzle unreachable.
10. **Backend special cases.** Grep for `_t ===`: `comparisonGLSL`, the GLSL
    `not` case, the WGSL `construct` narrowing, the WGSL uniform workaround that
    stores `bool` as `u32`, `isWgslTexture` / `isSamplerType` (integer textures
    take no WGSL sampler and fetch with `textureLoad`), `MATRIX_DIMENSIONS`,
    and the coercion ladders in the binary and ternary emitters.
11. **Document** in `docs/api.md` and the type tables in `docs/compilation.md`.
12. **Test** through the aliased compilers — the only automated check that steps
    3, 4, 5 and 10 were done.

## What catches what

| Mistake | Caught by |
|---|---|
| `ShaderType` with no `NodeOps` row | `tsc` |
| Missing `NodeImpl` method | test run — `TypeError` |
| Missing backend switch case | test run — throws, if exercised |
| Missing `REDUCING_OPS` / `VALUE_OPERAND` | real-compiler validation |
| Missing `UNIFORM_OPERAND_OPS` | Dawn only |
| Missing `typeToGLSL` / `typeToWGSL` / `TYPE_WIDTH` | real-compiler validation |
| Declared but never implemented | nothing |
| Wrong folding arithmetic, or swapped operands | evaluation layer |

The further down that table, the more your test needs to go through
`src/rmsl-usage.test.ts`.

## Pull requests

`pnpm type-check` and a full `pnpm test` with validation on. One logical change
per commit. New behaviour needs a test that would fail without it.
