/**
 * Checks that every shader the test suite generates is actually valid, in both
 * backends.
 *
 * The suite's assertions are substring matches — `expect(glsl).toContain(...)`
 * — which cannot tell a correct shader from a broken one that happens to
 * contain the expected text. Three real compiler bugs shipped through that gap:
 * `refract(I, N)` still contains "refract(", `lessThan(float, float)` still
 * contains "lessThan(", and a for-loop missing its increment is valid syntax.
 *
 * So the generated source is handed to real compilers instead of being pattern
 * matched. A parser is not enough — it accepts every one of those three, since
 * they are type errors rather than syntax errors:
 *
 *              1e-7.0   refract(I,N)   lessThan(f,f)   mat2x3 = 0.0
 *   parser     reject      accept         accept          accept
 *   real       reject      reject         reject          reject
 *
 * GLSL goes to Chromium's WebGL2 compiler, WGSL to Dawn. Both report type
 * errors, and both are the implementations the output actually has to run on.
 *
 * Wiring: a test file aliases the compilers through `recordGLSL`/`recordWGSL`,
 * so no individual test changes, then awaits `assertRecordedShadersValid()` in
 * `afterAll`.
