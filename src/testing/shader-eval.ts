/**
 * Runs a compiled expression and reports the number it produces.
 *
 * The rest of the suite checks that generated shaders *compile*. Nothing
 * checked that they *compute the right answer*, and those are different
 * questions: emitting `a - b` where `a + b` was meant compiles perfectly and
 * passes every text assertion. Mutation testing put a name to the gap — most
 * surviving mutants change what a shader calculates without making it invalid.
 *
 * So an expression is compiled to a function, called on both backends, and the
 * result compared against the same arithmetic in JS. Running both also makes
 * the backends checkable against each other: one RMSL program must produce one
 * number, and a divergence is a bug in whichever side disagrees with JS.
 *
 * GLSL renders to an RGBA32F texture and reads the red channel; WGSL dispatches
 * a compute shader and reads a storage buffer. Both return exact f32, so the
 * only tolerance needed is for f32 against JS's f64.
