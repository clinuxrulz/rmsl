/**
 * Testing utilities for shader logic, run on the CPU.
 *
 * A shader's arithmetic is ordinary logic — a colour ramp, a signed distance
 * field, a lighting term — and testing it should not need a browser, a canvas
 * or a graphics device. RMSL already compiles a node graph to a JavaScript
 * callable (see `compileJS`); this module is the part around it that makes the
 * callable pleasant to assert on: inputs given as the nodes themselves rather
 * than generated slot names, a whole grid of fragments evaluated in one call,
 * and comparisons that tolerate the last bit of a float.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { evaluate, render, approx } from "@random-mesh/rmsl/test";
 *
 * const colour = evaluate(() => ramp(), { uniforms: [[uTint, [1, 0, 0]]] });
 * expect(colour.value).toSatisfy(approx([1, 0, 0, 1]));
 * ```
 *
 * What runs here is the fragment (or vertex) function itself. There is no
 * rasterizer: no triangles, no interpolation, no depth test. A varying is a
 * value you pass in, which is what makes a single fragment addressable.
