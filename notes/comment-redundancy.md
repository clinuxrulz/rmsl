# Comment Redundancy Audit

**Criterion:** Does the comment add information the code itself does not already convey? Section headers that label what follows, inline comments that restate the code, and test comments that restate the test name are flagged for removal.

**Legend:**
- **REMOVE** — redundant: the code, function name, or test name already says the same thing.
- **KEEP** — adds value: explains *why*, non-obvious design rationale, language constraints, or subtle interactions the code cannot express.
- **N/A** — `describe`/`it` strings (not removable comments).

**Author:**
- **random mesh** — Clinton Selke
- **bigmistqke** — you

## `src/rmsl.ts` (core library)

### Section headers (REMOVE)

All `// === ... ===` dividers are redundant — they label the block, but the block's own names make it obvious. All written by **random mesh**.

## Summary

| Category | random mesh | bigmistqke | Total |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **REMOVE** (section headers) | ~37 | 0 | ~37 |
| **REMOVE** (trivial labels, restating code) | 5 | 10 | ~15 |
| **REMOVE** (restating test names) | 6 | 29 | ~35 |
| **KEEP** (design rationale, language constraints) | 1 | ~100 | ~101 |
| **KEEP** (harness design, non-obvious interactions) | 0 | ~40 | ~40 |

### Source of redundancy

**random mesh** wrote almost all section headers and trivial labels (~42 comments). **bigmistqke** wrote almost all test-file comments that restate the test name (~29 comments). Every KEEP comment explaining design rationale or language constraints is from **bigmistqke**.

The one random mesh comment worth keeping is `// WGSL for-init needs var not let` (line 2829) — it explains a string-manipulation trick that isn't obvious from the code.
