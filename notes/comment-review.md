# Comment Review: Diary Notes vs. State Descriptions

**Criterion:** Comments should describe the current state, not what used to be broken and is now fixed. Diary-like notes that narrate a bug's history or a fix's story are flagged for rewrite.

**Legend:**
- **DIARY** — describes what *was* broken, *was* dropping, *was* reaching, *was* typed as, etc. Rewrite to describe the current state.
- **OK** — describes the current state, design rationale, or language constraints as they stand today.
- **MIXED** — contains both diary and state content; the diary portion should be excised.
- **N/A** — section headers, `@ts-expect-error` directives, or trivial inline labels that are not narrative.

---

## `src/rmsl.ts` (core library)

### Section headers (`// === ... ===`)

All section dividers are `N/A` — they name the block, they don't narrate.

Lines: 3, 14, 26, 35, 61, 74, 97, 138, 327, 342, 366, 389, 397, 410, 413, 433, 440, 456, 463, 488, 519, 546, 769, 783, 833, 967, 1066, 1092, 1189, 1191, 1253, 1475, 1627, 1652, 1687, 2121, 2389, 2617, 3297

### Design rationale (OK)

Lines: 44-45, 160-166, 511, 784-786, 1475, 1627, 1652, 1687 — these explain *why* the code is structured the way it is, in present tense.

### Diary notes

| Lines | Verbatim text (trimmed) | Why it's diary |
|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| 207-210 | `Declaring them here as well gave the vector types two declarations, and this one's Node<"float"> return was wrong: GLSL's step returns genType` | "gave...two declarations" / "was wrong" — past tense narration of a bug |
| 346-348 | `the widths were previously checked only for the two square types, which let a mat3 times a vec4 through as well` | "were previously checked" / "let...through" — describes the old bug |
| 420-422 | `Left to op() it would be typed from the first operand, which is the matrix, and emitted as a float` | "Left to op() it would be" — hypothetical that narrates a bug path |
| 732-734 | `an unsigned operand compared against a plain number was reaching WGSL as u32 < i32` | "was reaching" — past tense narration |
| 1364-1372 | `Returning nothing used to end the check here... Asking the text meant comparing against "0.0"... a vertex shader returning zero was read as returning nothing and slipped through` | Entire block is diary — narrates a sequence of past bugs |
| 2034-2037 | `the fifth output declared anywhere landed at location 4 even in a shader that had only one — past MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS soon enough` | "landed at location 4" / "past MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS soon enough" — narrates old behavior and its consequences |
| 2318-2322 | `the tie used to be broken on the generated slot name, which carries a counter climbing for the life of the process, so the same program compiled twice could put its values at different addresses` | "used to be broken" — classic diary note |
| 665-677 (JSDoc) | `the backends disagreed about those: GLSL widened the operand and then could not narrow the result back, while WGSL truncated the literal and carried on` | "disagreed" — past tense, describes old behavior that no longer applies |
| 98-110 (JSDoc) | `The conditional form made the checker evaluate every branch... a self-referential op like not(): Node<A> exhausted its heap` | "made...expanded...exhausted" — full diary of a past design failure |
| 2133-2140 (JSDoc) | `Holding only the square ones let the non-square ones fall through the diagonal expansion below and reach WGSL as mat2x3<f32>(2f)` | "let...fall through...reach" — narrates an old bug |
| 2147-2158 (JSDoc) | `Expanding it instead produced mat3x3<f32>(m, 0f, 0f, 0f, m, ...), a constructor that does not exist` | "Expanding it instead produced" — narrates an old bug |

### Mixed notes (diary portion should be excised)

| Lines | Verbatim text (trimmed) | What to keep vs. remove |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 740-743 | `Neither language compares a vector against a scalar: GLSL has no lessThan(vec3, float) and WGSL no operator < (vec3<f32>, f32). The signatures accept the mix, so the scalar is broadcast` | **Keep** the first sentence (language constraint). **Remove** the "The signatures accept the mix" — that's describing an old design gap, not the current state. |
| 1460-1462 | `Reached before: its statements are already in the output, so only the expression naming the result is handed back` | **OK** — describes current behavior of DAG dedup. |
| 2004-2008 | `GLSL ES 3.00 removed gl_FragColor, so an output is declared for it. This mirrors the WGSL backend, which already emitted an implicit colour output — without it the same program rendered on WebGPU and produced nothing on WebGL2` | **Keep** first sentence (language constraint). **Remove** the "without it" clause — that narrates the old bug. |

### Diary notes

| Lines | Verbatim text (trimmed) | Why it's diary |

| 279-281 | `Typing the node after its first operand left _t as "vec2", which sent float comparisons down the vector path and emitted lessThan(float, float)` | "left _t as 'vec2'" / "sent float comparisons down" — narrates an old bug |
| 350-353 | `Typing it as float beside an integer operand made the operands disagree, so codegen inserted a conversion and produced int x = (float(u) % 2.0)` | "made the operands disagree" / "produced..." — narrates an old bug |

| 626-629 | `The check on the stage result did not know that had happened, so it demanded a vec4 result as well — and following its advice would have written the position twice` | "did not know" / "would have written" — narrates old bug |
| 649-652 | `Returning nothing was treated as "there is no result to check", but a vertex shader still has to produce a position somehow. One that returns nothing and never writes one compiles to a main that sets no position at all` | "was treated" — narrates old behavior |

| 1181-1182 | `Only the vec3 length had ever been exercised` | "had ever been exercised" — narrates past coverage gap |
| 1184-1186 | `writing it that way is how the first draft of this test got caught by the shader validation rather than by its own assertions` | "how the first draft...got caught" — narrates past incident |
| 1289-1294 | `WGSL's grammar allows a single statement there, and the rest were being dropped` | "were being dropped" — narrates old bug |
| 1345-1348 | `Arithmetic learned that; comparisons did not, so an unsigned operand was compared against a signed literal and WGSL had no such overload` | "learned that; did not" / "was compared" — narrates old bug |
| 1359-1361 | `the backends disagreed about what to do instead: GLSL widened the operand and then failed to narrow the result, WGSL truncated the literal silently` | "disagreed" / "failed" / "truncated" — narrates old behavior |
| 1374-1377 | `Splitting only looked at the immediate base, so a swizzle of a swizzle re-emitted the very form the split exists to avoid` | "only looked at" / "re-emitted" — narrates old bug |
| 1405-1408 | `A bool was already carried as a u32 and compared back on read` | "was already carried" — narrates old state |

| Lines | Verbatim text (trimmed) | What to keep vs. remove |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 480-482 | `The stage result went into every declared output, whatever its type and whatever the program had already written there. WGSL leaves declared outputs to the program's own assignments; GLSL now does too` | **Remove** first two sentences (diary). **Keep** third sentence only if reworded to "Declared outputs are assigned by the program." |

## Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| **DIARY** comments requiring rewrite | **~55** |
| **MIXED** comments requiring trim | **~5** |
| **OK** comments (state descriptions) | **~200+** |
| **N/A** (section headers, directives) | **~80** |

### Most common diary patterns

1. **"was reaching...as"** — describes old codegen output
2. **"used to be.../ was previously.../ was treated as"** — narrates old behavior
3. **"the tie was broken on... / the check existed to catch"** — narrates why something was built
4. **"dropped / let through / produced (a bad thing)"** — narrates old bug symptoms
5. **"the mutation run showed / the first draft of this test"** — narrates past measurement
6. **"backends disagreed / widened / truncated"** — narrates old cross-backend differences

### Recommended rewrite strategy

For each diary note, ask: *does a reader need this to understand the code as it is today?*

- **If yes**: rewrite as a present-tense description of the current state or constraint. Example: `"the widths were previously checked only for the two square types"` → `"Widths are checked for all matrix types."`
- **If no**: delete the comment entirely. The code itself should be self-documenting for things that are no longer surprising.
